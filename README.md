# React Drag Drop Video element

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This project is deployed [here](https://verdant-crepe-11f2a8.netlify.app/).

Note 1: Please test this on latest chrome for best results.
Note 2: This project was part of interview-assignment with limited amount of time.

## Assignment details

Create a video element (with any mp4/mov video) of size: 200:300px (width:height) and
place it at the bottom left of the screen.
You should be able to drag and drop the element at any corner of the screen. Consider
the screen to be of 4 quarters and when you drop the element at any quarter, it
should get placed at the corner of that quarter.
Requirements:

1. Should work in both mobile and desktop. Use React for this.
2. Write your own logic to handle Drag and Drop events
3. The video element should be in the pause state by default.
4. On click/touch of the video element, the video should play or pause.
5. On dragging, the video should move but go to a paused state irrespective of
   the current state(playing or pause) of the video.
6. You need to test it on a mobile device as well (not just on the desktop
   browser)

### Optional:

7. The transition after you release the video should be smooth.
8. Style the video container such that it stands out from the body.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
